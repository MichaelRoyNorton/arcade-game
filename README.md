# Memory Game Project

## Introduction

An Arcade project completed for my course with Udacity

## How to play the game

Control the character by using the arrow keys on your keyboard. The aim is to reach the water without being touched by the enemy (the bugs). Each time you reach the water you gain 5 points. Every time you touch a bug you lose a life. Reach 50 points and you win the game.
